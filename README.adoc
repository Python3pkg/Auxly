= Auxly

== Introduction
This project provides a Python 2.7/3.x library with common helper functions. Some of the functionality overlaps with the standard library but the API is slightly modified. The primary goal of this library is to simplify shell-like scripts written in Python.

== Status
The status of this project is **pre-alpha**. This project is not yet suitable for use other than testing.

== Requirements
Auxly should run on any Python 2.7/3.x interpreter without additional dependencies.
